## steemblog: A simple blog for steem blockchain

### Languages:
* HTML
* Node.js
## This is just a draft, we need more work. The vision is explained below:

There is a genuine need for diversification of steemit platform into various smaller genre based platforms for better engagement, better quality of submissions and incentivizing formation of communities that share the same passion.

For this purpose, I have created a new Github repository. Contributions are welcome for the same.

Now I introduce the basic framework for the new social steem blog named technum.io.

Similar but different from utopian.io.

Similarities:
Moderation: The website needs to be moderated strongly. The contributions that do accepted need to adhere to high standards of originality and just enrich steem blockchain. There is so much garbage on the blockchain that it is high time we start caring about what we really stand for and what is needed for long-term sustainability of steem blockchain and steem currency.

Interact freely with steem blockchain: All blog contribution would be available on steem blockchain where users not on technum.io can access and upvote the same from other steem interfaces including steemit.com, busy.org, chainBB etc.

Clutter-free design.

Engaged developers: The same way that @elear has been interacting freely with the new utopian.io community being developed.

Sponsors: Steem Whales and Dolphins who have long-term interest in the performance of steem blockchain would contribute to the project through SP delegation. A percentage of author awards through the platform will be reserved for the sponsors.

Administration: technum.io developers will organize themselves into teams and take up the job of taking care of the usual maintenance and administration of the website.
Differences:
Differentiation between contribution feed and friend feed. More detailed explaination is provided in the points below.

There would be two tabs for feed. The contribution feed would be directly linked to the steem blockchain, the same as in utopian.io feed. However, the friend feed would be completely off the steem blockchain. The reason for this differentiation is that anybody should be able to put up and like small and well-meaning statuses of their friends without having to think about voting power and curation awards.

The friend feed will Not feature blogs. It will feature what your friends are thinking. Are they stressed out because none of their blog posts are doing well? Do they need someone to proofread their contribution? Are they sick? Is anyone organizing a meetup nearby? Such things can be shared and discussed without any monetary consideration.

In-app chat on similar lines to facebook chat. Only those friends that are online should be shown.



Private messaging capability on similar lines to facebook. These messages are to be completely off the blockchain and privacy is ensured through encryption and by the technum.io administrators.

Paid advertising: The personal feed and discretely placed advertising that on one glance does not appear to be advertising at all. Very discrete and limited advertising is good for sustaining the efforts of team technum.io. Although if possible and if resources permit, we may delay advertising till an involved user base has been created.

The option to follow or follow and befriend a user. Only friends would be available for private chat and messages.
Replication of the same design for all other smaller steem blogs
Once a design is ready for one blog. The same design with minimal modification can be used for all other genre based steem blogs. We can have a blog for art lovers, fiction lovers, news lovers, adventure and life enthusiast.

Beta Version:
We may first bring out a beta version without messaging and chat which may be integrated at a later stage.
